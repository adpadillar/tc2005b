        <h2 id="1.0">1. Understanding the basics</h2>

        <h3 id="1.1">1.1 Head and body</h3>

        <p>
          When you’re building a website, you’re working with two main parts:
          the head and the body. The head is like the brain of the website,
          where you put all the important stuff that doesn’t show up on the
          page. This includes the title of the page, links to stylesheets, and
          meta information like keywords and descriptions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The body is where all the content of the page goes. This is where you
          put your text, images, videos, and anything else you want people to
          see when they visit your site.
        </p>

        <h3 id="1.2">1.2 Headings</h3>

        <p>
          Headings are an important part of any website. They help to break up
          the content and make it easier to read. There are six levels of
          headings in HTML, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> being the most
          important and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> being the least important.
        </p>

        <h3 id="1.3">1.3 Images</h3>

        <p>
          Images are a great way to make your website more visually appealing.
          You can use them to show off your products, illustrate your blog
          posts, or just add some color to your site. To add an image to your
          website, you use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.
        </p>

        <h3 id="1.4">1.4 Links</h3>

        <p>
          Links are what make the web work. They’re what allow you to move from
          one page to another, from one website to another, and from one part of
          a page to another. To create a link in HTML, you use the
          <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.
        </p>

        <h2 id="2.0">2. Javascript</h2>

        <h3 id="2.1">2.1 Variable types</h3>

        <p>
          In Javascript, there are several ways to declare a variable. You can
          use the <code>var</code> keyword, the <code>let</code> keyword, or the
          <code>const</code> keyword. Each of these has its own use cases and
          rules for how it can be used.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>var</code> keyword is the oldest way to declare a variable
          in Javascript. It has some quirks that can make it difficult to work
          with, so it’s generally recommended to use <code>let</code> or
          <code>const</code> instead.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>let</code> keyword was introduced in ES6 as a replacement
          for <code>var</code>. It has some advantages over <code>var</code>,
          such as block scoping and the ability to reassign values.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>const</code> keyword is used to declare a variable that
          can’t be reassigned. This can be useful when you want to make sure
          that a variable doesn’t change throughout your program.
